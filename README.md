# OpenTD
open source tournament management software

This software is a way to manage chess tournaments. Currently, we are building the Swiss format for tournaments. We use an
SQL database to keep track of players, rounds, games, and tournaments. We are building using JavaScript with the intention
of deploying on Discord.
